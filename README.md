This is the source code of my attempt on the  [NBME - Score Clinical Patient Notes](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nbme-score-clinical-patient-notes) competition on Kaggle. I worked alone and was fortunate to rank 11/1471 in the final evaluation. Credit to the [baseline](https://www.kaggle.com/code/yasufuminakama/nbme-deberta-base-baseline-train).
